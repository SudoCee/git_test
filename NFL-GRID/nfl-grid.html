                 based in the Buffalo metropolitan area. The Bills compete 
                 in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of 
                 the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division.
                  The team plays its home games at Highmark Stadium in Orchard 
                  Park, New York. Founded in 1960 as a charter member of the American
                   Football League (AFL), they joined the NFL in 1970 following the AFL–NFL 
                   merger. The Bills' name is derived from an All-America Football Conference 
                   (AAFC) franchise from Buffalo that was in turn named after western frontiersman
                    Buffalo Bill. Drawing much of its fanbase from Western New York,[7] the Bills 
                    are the only NFL team that plays home games in that state.[a] The franchise is 
                    owned by Terry and Kim Pegula, who purchased the Bills after the death of original 
                    owner Ralph Wilson in 2014.</p>
